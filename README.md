# DEFRAGMENTATION


The simulation has fractured. A perfect architecture of order and logic has dissolved into infinite darkness. All that remains are drifting shards of corrupted code — vivid, broken shapes that twist and surge, fighting to preserve the collapse. You are the last active process, a lone program moving through the void. Erasing what is broken. Restoring what can be saved. Each recovered fragment pulls the world back into focus — and with it, the memory of what was lost.

Defragmentation is a fast-paced shooter inspired by glitches, lasers, and abstract art that is set in a gloomy minimalistic world. A short 15-minute experience, it is a product of our internal game gam and a beginning of the series of shorter projects called Microcosm.
